# RL Mountain car project
The goal of the project is to solve a gymnasium environment as MountainCar using a q-table and compare the results with a deep q-network.
In the image below you can see the policy learned by the machine after approximately 4000 episodes.
The Deep q-network has been implemented in python with Tensorflow.
## Improvement
Using the deep q-network I reduced the number of episodes needed to resolve the environment from 80000 to 4000 therefore with an improvement of 95%.
